<th> Original Problem
<th> <font size="2"> Suppose you are the driver of a trolley. The trolley
rounds a bend, and there come into view ahead five track workmen, who
have been repairing the track. The track goes through a bit of a valley at
that point, and the sides are steep, so you must stop the trolley if you are
to avoid running the five men down. You step on the brakes, but alas they
don't work. Now you suddenly see a spur of track leading off to the right.
You can turn the trolley onto it, and thus save the five men on the straight
track ahead. Unfortunately, there is one track workman on that spur of track. He can no more get off the track in
time than the five can, so you will kill him if you turn the trolley onto him. Do you kill the one workman saving five, or do you do nothing and let the five people die?
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Fat Man
      <th> a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you â€“ your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Surgeon Problem
      <th>At the moment you have five patients
who need organs. Two need one lung each, two need a kidney each, and
the fifth needs a heart. If they do not get those organs today, they will all
die; if you find organs for them today, you can transplant the organs and
they will all live. But where to find the lungs, the kidneys, and the heart?
The time is almost up when a report is brought to you that a young man
who has just come into your clinic for his yearly check-up has exactly the
right blood-type, and is in excellent health. Lo, you have a possible donor.
All you need do is cut him up and distribute his parts among the five who
need them. You ask, but he says, "Sorry. I deeply sympathize, but no."
Would it be morally permissible for you to operate anyway?

<div><h2 align="center"> Facts About the Trolley Problem</h2></div>
<ul id="list">
<li><center> The Original Trolley Problem was created by  Philippa Foot
  <li> Studied as an ethical dilemma by people all over the world
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism">A question of human morality, and an example of a philosophical view called consequentialism </a>
      <li>The Trolley Problem is used to help program self-driving cars
        <li>The most common solution to the problem is the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism">Utilitarian</a></em> view of killing one person to save five
          <li>Many people believe there is no right answer to the dilema
            <li>The other most popular approach is the <a href="https://www.nwabr.org/sites/default/files/Principles.pdf"><em>do-no-harm</em></a> approach
              <li>About 90% of people chose to kill the one and save the five
                <li>Many people also believe the Trolley problem is such a radical scenario that it really is a pointless issue
                  <li>There has never been and most likely never will be a universally agreed upon answer to the Trolley Problem
                 </center></ul>
                 <h2 class="klug" align=center> My Opinion</h2>
                 <p align=center> Now before I start this is 100% my opinion, without anyones else's ideas or views. And with that being said, I believe that there is no right answer to the Trolley Problem. In either scenario, the person who is making the choice will be responsible for the death of at least one person. Now I understand the whole killing one to save five idea, the idea of doing something for the "greater good" but, I also understand why someone would not want to get involved and let nature take its course instead of trying to play god. Either way someone dies and the person will feel guilty because they will inevitably be killing another human being. Every person has a slightly different view on a issue like this and therefore there cannot and will not ever be a right answer.  </p>
                 <h2 class="klug" align=center>One Final Point</h2>
                 <p align=center> Allow me to leave you with one final point to ponder. Just think have you ever heard of any scenario similar to the Trolley problem occuring in real life? I believe this problem is so outdated that is should just be 86'd all together. I challenge you to come up with a better ethical dilemma than the outdated Trolley Problem and send it to me at not-a-real-email@not-gmail.com </p>
