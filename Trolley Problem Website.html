<th> Original Problem
<th> <font size="2"> Suppose you are the driver of a trolley. The trolley
rounds a bend, and there come into view ahead five track workmen, who
have been repairing the track. The track goes through a bit of a valley at
that point, and the sides are steep, so you must stop the trolley if you are
to avoid running the five men down. You step on the brakes, but alas they
don't work. Now you suddenly see a spur of track leading off to the right.
You can turn the trolley onto it, and thus save the five men on the straight
track ahead. Unfortunately, there is one track workman on that spur of track. He can no more get off the track in
time than the five can, so you will kill him if you turn the trolley onto him. Do you kill the one workman saving five, or do you do nothing and let the five people die?
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Fat Man
      <th> a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you â€“ your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Surgeon Problem
      <th>At the moment you have five patients
who need organs. Two need one lung each, two need a kidney each, and
the fifth needs a heart. If they do not get those organs today, they will all
die; if you find organs for them today, you can transplant the organs and
they will all live. But where to find the lungs, the kidneys, and the heart?
The time is almost up when a report is brought to you that a young man
who has just come into your clinic for his yearly check-up has exactly the
right blood-type, and is in excellent health. Lo, you have a possible donor.
All you need do is cut him up and distribute his parts among the five who
need them. You ask, but he says, "Sorry. I deeply sympathize, but no."
Would it be morally permissible for you to operate anyway?
